# interest-payment-calculator
By asking the user a loan amount, the annual interest rate and the amount of years of payment for that loan, the algorithm calculates the total payment based on the result of the sum of the loan + the total interest rate and divides that by that number of months of payment. Finally, it writes on the terminal the monthly payment for that loan.
